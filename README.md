# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Russian-Roulette-Edition
This CLI game is like any normal game of rock, paper and scissors but with a twist. When first starting out, you're given 100 health, 0 points. As you play the game, each time you win you gain health and points. Each time you lose, you lose health and points. Instructions are in more details in the code itself. I hope you enjoy this silly game.
